This program is an astronomical data viewer. It is my attempt at being a clone to ATV for idl or DS9.
It is missing features and could have some of the ones worked out better, but It is capable of being
used to view fits files, and view properties of selected stars.

To install
from the command line run python setup.py install to have it install to the default site packages 
directory.

To run the program you can launch it with ntv from the command line.

This can also be embeded into python interactive session.
When in python,
from NTV import *
some_instance_name = NTV.embed()

to show an array:
some_instance_name.showArray()

Requirements:
---------------
Numpy
Scipy
Matplotlib
Pyfist
PyQt4
Python > 2.6 OR multiprocessing package installed
