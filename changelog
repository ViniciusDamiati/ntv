### version 0.1.2 ###
nate lust: 	removed arbitrary plot labels, and updated readme

### version 0.2 ###
nate lust: 	created changelog
		updated the minimap preview to reflect current scale appropriately
		updated manifest.in to include changelog
		Fixed issue where multiple button presses would create problems when picking star
		Fixed issue with details view generation, occationally a float division error was
			being generated when the fitgaussian function was failing
		Added the ability to change the aperature size and annulus size from within the 
			dialog box by clicking and draging the positions.
		Fixed a bug where the background value was not being subtracted out of the photometry
		TO DO: still need to get color map correct
### version 0.3 ###
nate lust:	Fixed a bug where you could set aperature diameter or annulus diameter to less than
			zero.
		Using the open functions of the drag and drop features from embeded mode should now
			work, please test
		Created a fits header viewer, invoke it with file header or ctl-h, needs a bit of work
			for justifying the text
		Updated the color pallet to be a bit more pleasing on eyes
		Updated the centering in details view to a two step process, first find maximum pixel
			in the cut size, recut based on that max position to ensure the fitgaussian
			sees and fits appropriately
		Put together three D support, still need to impliment playback support
		Updated comments in code
		Implemented play back support in threeD view window
		Updated Details view to persist, and be nonModal, in order to have more than one open
			at a time. May make it as an option to have them open in same window.
		Fixed constraints and drawing problems in the details view for small arrays.
		Updated details view to better handle small arrays, with small cutsizes
		Updated minimap to handle edge events better, can go out toward edge, where pointer
			will go up to within three pixels of the edge, ie the border of cursor will
			go right to edge.Still need a bit of work with really small arrays
		Updated minimap to scale more appropriately for small arrays, higher scale due to
			smaller cut size, since array is much smaller. Still have a bit of issue with
			the pointer in small minimap.
		Updated spelling in details view.
